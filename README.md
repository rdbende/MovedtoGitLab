# Why I moved to GitLab?

I always had concerns that GitHub is owned by Micro$oft. After all, what Micro$oft acquires doesn't have a bright future. Just look at what happened to Hotmail or Skype. Anyways, I'm glad that they haven't required a Micro$oft 365 subscription to use GitHub yet. Let's hope they never will. But nevertheless, they are on the way to ruin it.

Since everyone is using GitHub (because everyone else is using Github), I thought I should too, if I actually want to do something. And I feel I was right, just look at my GitHub profile :)\
But now it was enough for me. GitHub is going in a really bad direction.

For example, why the heck do I get an award for merging a PR without review or closing an issue within five minutes? Why does this GitHub encourage people to spam?\
Why do I need a "For you" tab on my dashboard? GitHub is not a social media platform where you get never-ending amount of content in your feed! And anyway, there is an "Explore repositories" section already, isn't that enough?

And of course, I can disable awards on my profile, and use uBlock Origin to remove the "For you" tab, and the "Latest changes" section (why on earth do we need that? I don't care about the changelog, but if I do, I can check it elsewhere), my problem is not with that.\
My problem is with the fact that these things exist at all. My problem is with GitHub's philosophy. It's not a social media platform, neither is it a gaming platform, it's the place "Where the world builds software". It's for serious work, not just for joke. I really can't understand, why GitHub is doing this.

I don't want to wait until the platform becomes complete garbage, so I moved my personal repositories to GitLab, and only left my better known projects here, because I can't just simply make them disappear from one moment to the next, however I will no longer develop them on GitHub.\
From now on I'll only use this account to contribute to projects that are hosted on GitHub, but I won't create new projects here.

This is why I #movedtogitlab

And anyways, Tanuki is lot cooler than Octocat ;)
